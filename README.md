# ColdfusionWebservices
Files that can be used to handle webservices in coldfusion (this version is compatible with Coldfusion 7/8 only!)

- ClearWebservices.cfm: provides 2 simple options
  - KILL - kill all webservices loaded in cache (best option to make sure you clear everything)
  - REFRESH - refreshes the already loaded webservices
